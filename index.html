				   <p> As I believe these aspects  lead to the success and at times faliure of the team</p>
                   <h3 id="Communication">Communication</h3>	
				   <p>With Two core principles of Agile being “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools” and “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation,” its safe to say that good communication leads to success and is a key part of functioning in a professional atmosphere.  Throughout the project, I felt as though my communication with the team was one of my strongest aspects.  I felt that there were very few times during the semester I wasn’t aware of where someone was up to on a given task.  This enabled me to assist others when they were struggling and vice versa.  However after reflection, I feel as though the manner that I was communicating to certain members of the team was unprofessional.  During the final six weeks due to fatigue and frustration, I found myself being highly critical of others for a lack of work completed.  Although I believe that criticism is important for improvement moving forward, I feel like rather than helping members be aware of what they need to work on, I was just venting my frustration.  Consequently, I was just further discouraging a team member who was already feeling bad for letting the team down.  In the future I will try to take a moment to decide if my input or critique is productive, or if my time would be better spent trying to help or motivate. </p>
                    <p>An aspect of communication I felt I improved on over the project was my ability to communicate with the client.  At the start of the project the team underestimated the importance of this aspect of Agile.  As a result, when showing the client the web site after the first sprint, my task “show all dates of a given semester” wasn’t what the client wanted.  Luckily this functionality in the website was easily changed to meet the requirements.  It helped the team realise the importance of constant communication, as it quite easily could of lead to two weeks of wasted work in the future.  As such, it was mentioned in sprint one’s retrospective as something the team needs to work on.  Moving forward I tried to ask more questions and get a better grasp on what the client was asking for.  As a result, we had no further misunderstandings of what was required from us, with most changes being slight critiques or personal preference of the client.</p>
					 <p>Throughout the project the team was encouraged to scrum daily.  Due to conflicting time schedules and some laziness on our part, this was far from a regular occurrence.  With the team selecting to keep in touch over Facebook messenger, I started to notice how important it was to encourage face to face communication.  Personally, I tried to have a quick conversation with team mates about what we were working on, or where we were up-to whenever we ran into each other.  This allowed me to be informed on all aspects of the project.  In contrast, it felt like other members were not quite up to speed with where the project was at or what needed to be worked on.  From this experience, I’ve learnt that although messenger has its uses, it’s not an effective or professional way of conveying information.  Moving forward, I would use it to organise times for meetings or get a quick response from someone.  I would also try to encourage more, full team scrums and meetings, as it would be far more efficient and productive.</p>
				   <h3 id="Leadership">Leadership</h3>
				    <p>At the start of the semester I joined a team not knowing anyone or their level of skill.  As a result, I was a little uneasy voicing my opinion, let alone directing others.  As the project moved along, I became a little more confident and quickly realised I had a lot to offer the team.  This was due to having a good grasp on where the project was at, related to the reasons discussed in the communication aspects.  During the middle and end portions of the project I found myself stepping into more of a leadership role.  I think a big part of this was always being available for people to bounce ideas off. By being up-to date on what’s going on, I was able to give good advice and at times help team members focus on what was important to the project.  I also learnt that although this was a group project at times, someone needs to step up and take charge.  This does not mean making all decisions by them self or bossing others around; It’s about understanding what needs to be done and how to go about it, leading others in the right direction or facilitating group discussions.  In the future the aspect I would focus on, is trying to organise meetings and facilitate group discussions.  As touched upon earlier, the team had issues scheduling regular meetings.  Shown below I tried to encourage meetings, but in reality, the effort was lacking.  I think moving forward organising more meetings would put more of an expectation of team members to attend when available. </p>
