				   <p> As I believe these aspects  lead to the success and at times faliure of the team</p>
                   <h3 id="Communication">Communication</h3>	
				   <p>With Two core principles of Agile being “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools” and “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation,” its safe to say that good communication leads to success and is a key part of functioning in a professional atmosphere.  Throughout the project, I felt as though my communication with the team was one of my strongest aspects.  I felt that there were very few times during the semester I wasn’t aware of where someone was up to on a given task.  This enabled me to assist others when they were struggling and vice versa.  However after reflection, I feel as though the manner that I was communicating to certain members of the team was unprofessional.  During the final six weeks due to fatigue and frustration, I found myself being highly critical of others for a lack of work completed.  Although I believe that criticism is important for improvement moving forward, I feel like rather than helping members be aware of what they need to work on, I was just venting my frustration.  Consequently, I was just further discouraging a team member who was already feeling bad for letting the team down.  In the future I will try to take a moment to decide if my input or critique is productive, or if my time would be better spent trying to help or motivate. </p>
                    <p>An aspect of communication I felt I improved on over the project was my ability to communicate with the client.  At the start of the project the team underestimated the importance of this aspect of Agile.  As a result, when showing the client the web site after the first sprint, my task “show all dates of a given semester” wasn’t what the client wanted.  Luckily this functionality in the website was easily changed to meet the requirements.  It helped the team realise the importance of constant communication, as it quite easily could of lead to two weeks of wasted work in the future.  As such, it was mentioned in sprint one’s retrospective as something the team needs to work on.  Moving forward I tried to ask more questions and get a better grasp on what the client was asking for.  As a result, we had no further misunderstandings of what was required from us, with most changes being slight critiques or personal preference of the client.</p>
					 <p>Throughout the project the team was encouraged to scrum daily.  Due to conflicting time schedules and some laziness on our part, this was far from a regular occurrence.  With the team selecting to keep in touch over Facebook messenger, I started to notice how important it was to encourage face to face communication.  Personally, I tried to have a quick conversation with team mates about what we were working on, or where we were up-to whenever we ran into each other.  This allowed me to be informed on all aspects of the project.  In contrast, it felt like other members were not quite up to speed with where the project was at or what needed to be worked on.  From this experience, I’ve learnt that although messenger has its uses, it’s not an effective or professional way of conveying information.  Moving forward, I would use it to organise times for meetings or get a quick response from someone.  I would also try to encourage more, full team scrums and meetings, as it would be far more efficient and productive.</p>
				   <h3 id="Leadership">Leadership</h3>
				    <p>At the start of the semester I joined a team not knowing anyone or their level of skill.  As a result, I was a little uneasy voicing my opinion, let alone directing others.  As the project moved along, I became a little more confident and quickly realised I had a lot to offer the team.  This was due to having a good grasp on where the project was at, related to the reasons discussed in the communication aspects.  During the middle and end portions of the project I found myself stepping into more of a leadership role.  I think a big part of this was always being available for people to bounce ideas off. By being up-to date on what’s going on, I was able to give good advice and at times help team members focus on what was important to the project.  I also learnt that although this was a group project at times, someone needs to step up and take charge.  This does not mean making all decisions by them self or bossing others around; It’s about understanding what needs to be done and how to go about it, leading others in the right direction or facilitating group discussions.  In the future the aspect I would focus on, is trying to organise meetings and facilitate group discussions.  As touched upon earlier, the team had issues scheduling regular meetings.  Shown below I tried to encourage meetings, but in reality, the effort was lacking.  I think moving forward organising more meetings would put more of an expectation of team members to attend when available. </p>

<h3 id="Team work">Team work</h3>
 <p>I Believe team work is where the group showed the most Agile traits.  Being self-organised, delivering software frequently, and taking time to reflect on how to be become more effective as a team, were all regular occurrences throughout the project.  </p>
  <p>When it comes to project the idea of working in a team is dreaded by most, in reality, it’s part of the professional world.  From my perspective working in a team is what you make of it; having people to share the work load or bounce ideas off can be amazing.  Multiple times throughout the project, large task and troubleshooting Laravel was overcome by a collaboration of ideas from team members.  A great example of this was during the fourth sprint, Joe and I had very similar tasks, simply allowing the user to enter data and have it display on the web site.   Joe had figured out how to get the data from the user and insert it into the data base but was stuck on displaying it.  Between the two of us we were able to find the issue.  As a result, I was quickly able to complete my given task using his work as a model, maximizing the amount of work not done.  By working together on his issue, it drastically cut the time required to finish mine.  </p>
   <p>On multiple occasions I found myself helping others by letting them drive the computer while I gave advice.  I found this to be an effective way of still being helpful without taking over their work.  It helps team members build confidence while also learning how to use new software.  From these experiences, I learnt that sometimes the best way to help your-self is to assist others, and simply talking someone through their problem rather than fixing it can be more beneficial in the long run. </p>
    <p>Although team work has it place, I feel like there is a limit to the amount of help you are able to offer someone.  Throughout the project we had one user story that was continuously unfinished.  As a result, it greatly hindered the progress of the project as the feature was critical for the completion of future work.  On multiple occasions I tried to assist and give direction on the task, but felt like the team member was intending for me to give him the solution or do the work for him. Due to having my own work to complete, I didn’t really have the time and felt like the advice I had given should be enough to set him in the right direction.  As the project dragged on, he was intent on trying to finish the user story but was not making progress.  In the closing weeks I came the realisation that the team member just wasn’t willing to put the time in required to solve the problem, therefore I took over the task and completed it.  Looking back this decision needed to be made earlier, as by the time this happened we had very limited time to implement other features around this functionality.  From this I learnt that although it is important to spread work evenly around team members, you can’t always expect others to be willing or able to put the same amount of work in you are.  Moving forward I would be less inclined to allow team members to continuously be assigned the same task they are struggling with.   Giving someone else the time to attempt the task and bring fresh ideas would be more productive. </p>
	<p>One of the biggest complaints I received from other team members was how I laid out my code.  Due to a poor use of tabbing out work and a lack of comments, it made it hard for others to work on.  With prior projects being worked on by myself, this has never been something I have considered an issue.  Moving forward I am going to try and be more consistent with formatting and leaving comments, as others working on my code is going to be a regular occurrence in the future.  </p>
   <h3 id="Time Managment">Time Managment</h3>
 <p> From sprint one the team struggled with managing our time effectively, with last minute meetings being a regular occurrence to finish off work.  This heavily impacted our ability to get feedback from the client before the end of a sprint.  On a few occasions this lead to user story’s being incomplete and having to be finished off in the following sprint.  With “Continuous attention to technical excellence” being crucial to agile, leaving everything to the last minute I was producing suboptimal buggy code.  As a result more time had to be spent by myself or others fixing the mistakes.  Moving forward I would like to try complete tasks earlier to allow more time for bug testing and code tidy up. </p>
  <p>I also ran into problems with not being able to complete task due to relying on the completion of others work.  This became an issue during the second sprint when I was implementing a CSS framework and layout for the website. I found it hard to decide on a layout and implement the new library when others were still working on the code themselves.  This highlighted to me the importance of planning the teams time and resources before the start of a new sprint.  If the team had been aware that my task required them to be finished a day or two before the end of the sprint, we could have planned our time accordingly.  This was touched upon in the sprint retrospective. Subsequently, the team spent time at the start of a sprint discussing what was required for each user story.</p>
   <p>Personally, I am aware that I have terrible time management and have been working on it this year.  By spending more time at the polytechnic, I found myself being less distracted and completing work well before its due date.  During the last few weeks I saw the effect of my change in routine.  By completing my task with in the first week of the sprint, I was free to assist others during the last week; I spent this time assisting Callum fixing hard coded java variables. From this experience I learnt that although others around me may have poor time management, ensuring I manage my time effectively still benefits the project greatly.  Moving forward I would try and continue this behaviour and hope it influences others around me. </p>
<h3 id="Motivating self and others">Motivating self and others</h3>			
 <p>Being a team project, I found the pressure of others depending on me to be a great motivator to get work done.  By not wanting to let the team down, I tried to ensure all tasks given to me were completed in a timely fashion. I think this motivation was a huge factor in my change in attitude towards time management and will be something I try to replicate in all aspects of work and study in the future.  The ideas of “working software being the primary measure of progress” and “delivering working software frequently” Also help motivate the team.  By deciding on what we thought was a realistic goal each sprint, the work load never felt overbearing.  Personally, I found that this made it feel like we were always making progress. </p>
 <p>I Feel like as the group became comfortable with each other, motivating other team members became second nature.  I found that when I started to form a relationship with team mates outside of just working on the same project, working together felt like less of a chore and I started to enjoy myself.  I was more willing to ask for help and lend a hand to others when they asked for it.  The aspect that I would like to focus more on in the future is celebrating little victories of other team members. On multiple occasions throughout the project I found myself disregarding other members successes, as I felt like the task was easy or insignificant.  Looking back, simply taking the time to acknowledge their work would go a long way to encouraging them to continue their hard work in the future.  </p>

				   <h3 id="Sprint1">Sprint 1</h3>
				   <p>For the first sprint I was allocated the user story of showing all dates for a given semester.  With Callum providing the team with a basic HTML skeleton, my only real task was to research the dates required.  With my web skills being extremely rusty, I spent this extra time brushing up on basic HTML so I wouldn’t be letting the team down in the future.</p>
				   <p>This was also the first time using Git hub in a team environment, as such I had to make adjustments in my committing behaviour. I started out using the command “git add *” whenever adding files to the project. I quickly discovered this was a terrible idea as I started to commit over other peoples work.  After being informed on how to add single files as well as using “git status” to see what files I had worked on, I quickly adjusted my behaviour. </p>
				 
				  <h3 id="Sprint2">Sprint 2</h3>
				  <p>During this sprint I decide to step outside my comfort zone and selected to find the team a framework for the website. With web design being one of my weak points, this seemingly straight forward task took longer than expected.  Due to having a limited knowledge of CSS and HTML most frame works I researched seemed overly complex for what we required it for.  After a week of stressing and self-regret, I stumbled upon the W3schools library; a simplistic but elegant solution to my problem.  With great documentation on the website, it was easy to use and educate the team on how it worked.</p>
				  <p> Again, I ran into git hub issues this sprint when I deleted all files in my local repository and replaced them with copy from a flash drive.  At the time the reasoning behind this was I had been trailing different CSS frameworks.  I quickly discovered this confused git hub as it would no longer allow me to pull or push.  After seeking help from Elise, I was informed of another new command “Git reset HARD –head” from my understanding this resets the local files back to the last point that I pulled from master.  In the next class we were shown how to create branches, a way to create copies of the master project that could be abandoned if anything went wrong. </p>
				  
				  <h3 id="Sprint3">Sprint 3</h3>
				  <p>For the third sprint the team was introduced to Laravel, a php framework. With the introduction of the new framework all progress seemed to come grinding to a halt. Like anything new it took some time for me to get my head around how Laravel functioned. I understood what it was doing behind the scenes due to learning php in web 2. However, I wasn’t sure how to get the views working and was a little flustered by the large file hierarchy.  To overcome this I spent a lot of time working with Corey and Joe trying to complete the tutorial we were given.  Between the three of us we were able to figure out how to get data saving and where files needed to be put.  At this stage I still felt as though I  had gaps in my knowledge using the framework. </P>
				  <p>Along-side Laravel, we were shown Mamp, a local server environment.  This allowed us to simulate the environment of our live server.  After understanding the process of installing composer and where to point it, I was able to help get other team members get up to speed. </p>
				  <h3 id="Sprint4">Sprint 4</h3>
				  <p>Being the last sprint before the holidays, the motivation for me and the team was a little low.  My task for the sprint “Store a paper and its day” seemed very similar to the task we had completed in the previous week. I was quick to discover I had been over confident and was still struggled getting laravel to function as intended. To overcome this hurdle I again relied on my team to help me. Together we will filled the gaps in each other’s knowledge and managed to help each other get a better grasp on how to use Laravel.  </p>
				  <p>On the final day of the sprint, Corey, Joe and I sat down and did some much needed admin. This involved pulling all the up to date code to the webserver, fixing the old links from our static website, and making sure it was functioning as intended.  During this time, I my self was not physically driving the computer, but was on hand to trouble shoot and give input where needed.  One of the biggest issues we faced was getting links to send the user to the appropriate page.  We soon discovered that we needed to change a configuration file in Laravel that adds the correct prerequisite to the URL.  When changing some other important configuration files for the server, both Corey and I are comfortable using a VIM, as such we didn’t hesitate to make the changes on the webserver its self. When we tried to push these changes back to git hub we discovered we were unable to.  Elise later informed us it was best practice to make changes outside of the server and then pull.  </p>

				  <p>This sprint was when I finally felt I had a grasp on how Laravel worked.  I managed to implement the semester start dates saved into the data base and have all days of the semester load dynamically into the web page.  Due to Prasanth having started the code required to display the semester when only give the start date, I was quickly able solve the issues he was having with the logic. This just left loading the dynamic data into the loop displaying the days.  Due to this functionality being bundled into having only specific days of the week displaying, there is no evidence of this being completed other than the commit shown below </P>

				  <p>For the final sprint the team decided on just tackling task that were deemed important to the basic functionality. During this sprint I finished off the user story stared in the previous week. To tackle this task, I was required to learn some basic java script that allowed me to hide elements by ID.  I was quick to find resources online that allowed me to get the table hiding and displaying certain days.  During this process I learnt that I could group items in a table by col groups and could use java script to hide/show these elements.  In a rush to complete my task, I did not fully test my code and as a result a bug was discovered,  when more than one semester was loaded in, the second table would not filter as intended.  I later discovered that the title of the table was being selected by its ID which is reserved as a unique identifier. As a result the java script would only find the first tables instance of this ID. To overcome this issue, I removed all ID tags and added these elements to the class for the given column. Although the filter applied to all semesters, not just the one the user is focusing on, the team was content with this functionality. </p>
				  <p>I was also able to help Callam fix some hard-coded titles by teaching him how to retrieve data from the data base and implement them around the website.  During this we both learnt the correct syntax to use when implementing a mixture of HTML and PHP into a title. </p>
